ðŸ“„ Cover Letter (Clarence Obini)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities that align with my background in artificial intelligence, data engineering, and full-stack development. With hands-on experience building intelligent systems and automating workflows, I bring a strong combination of technical expertise and problem-solving ability to any team I join.

In my recent role, I led the development of a large-scale automation system that integrated task data across two major project management platforms. Using Node.js, Firestore, and Google Apps Script, I implemented a high-performance data pipeline that handled thousands of records, optimized API usage, and significantly improved operational efficiency.

Beyond backend systems, Iâ€™ve also built mobile and web applications using React Native and Firebase, and Iâ€™ve deployed machine learning models using TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Whether itâ€™s streamlining processes with automation or creating predictive models, I focus on delivering scalable, practical solutions that create real value.

Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to contribute to a forward-thinking organization and bring my skills to new challenges. Thank you for considering my applicationâ€”I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Clarence Obini
